										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to various magic, the human race has been saved from calamity many, many times. Retaining his memories from his previous life, a boy, Shin, was picked up by an old man known to the world as the &#8220;Magi.&#8221;<br />
Shin was brought up by the Magi, who had retired to a secular place, as his own grandson. With the memories of his past life, he absorbed the Magi&#8217;s craft and grew to be able to develop his own magic<br />
Then, the grandfather told him he has to become independent when he reaches the age of 15.<br />
&#8220;Ah, I forgot to teach him common sense.&#8221;<br />
The grandson who has grown beyond the level of normal people, lacked common sense; the common sense of the world. So to learn how to socialize, he goes to Earlshide Kingdom City to be admitted to Earlshide Advanced Magic Academy.</p>
